# PV module simulations
Code used for PV module simulations, differente mathematical models implemented with the intent of searching the most efficient and precise methods

# Programming language
The final product will be implemented in ANSI C, but as it is currently in prototyping phase, Lua was chosen as the scripting language, due to it's good interfacing with C and ease of use

# Done
- Lua implementation (testing)
    - Single Diode
    - Params based

# TODO
- Lua implementation (testing)
    - Two diode
